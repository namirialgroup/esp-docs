# ESP

ESP is an implementation of a Service Provider that wraps the [Shibboleth SP 2](https://shibboleth.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/SHIB2/overview) software.

## Authentication methods 

ESP provides to your software the capability to login with the italian [SPID](https://www.spid.gov.it/en/) and [CIE](https://www.cartaidentita.interno.gov.it/) authentication methods.

See the [project website](https://namirialgroup.github.io/esp-docs/) for documentation and APIs.
